# Library-Go-API

# A simple Go-based Library API that allows users to borrow and return books. The API provides endpoints to check out books, return them, and view the status of available books. It ensures proper tracking of borrowed books and prevents double-checking out of the same book. Ideal for small-scale library management systems
